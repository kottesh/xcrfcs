A simple X pointer focus (xptrf) using XCB.

## Roadmap

- [ ] create a circular window
- [ ] replace the pointer with window 
- [ ] update the graphic content of the window with right below screen. 
- [ ] cover the whole display with translucent black or white window.

**May be...**  
- [ ] create in and out animation
